# aruco-pose-estimation
This repository contains all the code you need to generate an ArucoTag, detect ArucoTags in images and videos, and then use the detected tags to estimate the pose of the object.


This software is partially base on [this repository](https://github.com/GSNCodes/ArUCo-Markers-Pose-Estimation-Generation-Python).
